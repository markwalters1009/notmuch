NOTMUCH PICK

Notmuch pick is an experimental threaded message view for the emacs
interface. Each message is one line in the results and the thread
structure is shown using UFT-8 box drawing characters (similar to
Mutt's threaded view). It comes between search and show in terms of
amount of output and can be useful for viewing both single theads and
multiple threads.

INSTALL

Before installing notmuch-pick notmuch itself should have been
configured, made, and installed.

Then "make" should compile notmuch-pick, and "make install" should
install it in the same place as the rest of notmuch.

If you have a more unusual setup just copy the notmuch-pick.elc file
(or just the notmuch-pick.el file) somewhere in your emacs load-path.

Finally after the "(require 'notmuch)" line in your .emacs file add
the line "(require 'notmuch-pick)". This will load notmuch-pick on
your next emacs start.

USING PICK

The main key entries to notmuch pick are

'z' enter a query to view using notmuch pick (works in hello, search,
    show and pick itself).
'Z' view the current query in pick (works from search and show)
'M-RET' view the selected thread in pick (works in search mode)

Once in pick mode keybinding are mostly inline with the rest of
notmuch and are all viewable with '?' as usual.

CUSTOMISING PICK

Pick has several customisation variables. The most significant is the
first notmuch-pick-show-out which determines the behaviour when
selecting a message (with RET) in the pick view. By default pick uses
a split window showing the single message in the bottom pane. However,
if this option is set then it views the whole thread in the complete
window jumping to the selected message in the thread. In either case
M-RET selects the other option.
